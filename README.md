## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive guide to various supervised learning regression algorithms. Each section covers a different regression technique, offering both theoretical insights and practical implementations. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how these algorithms work, where they can be applied, and how to implement them in a real-world context.

## Algorithms

### Simple Linear Regression

**Overview**: Simple Linear Regression is the most basic form of regression analysis. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable by fitting a linear equation.

**Use Cases**:
- Predicting sales based on advertising expenditure.
- Estimating housing prices based on the square footage.

**Implementation & Analysis**: [Link to the Simple Linear Regression notebook/script]

### Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

**Overview**: Multiple Linear Regression extends Simple Linear Regression by modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

**Use Cases**:
- Predicting a person's weight based on height, age, and gender.
- Forecasting economic indicators based on multiple financial variables.

**Implementation & Analysis**: [Link to the MLR notebook/script]

### Ridge Regression

**Overview**: Ridge Regression is a regularized version of Multiple Linear Regression that penalizes large coefficients to prevent overfitting.

**Use Cases**:
- Handling multicollinearity in regression models.
- Improving predictive accuracy when the number of predictors is large.

**Implementation & Analysis**: [Link to the Ridge Regression notebook/script]

### Polynomial Regression

**Overview**: Polynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.

**Use Cases**:
- Modeling non-linear relationships.
- Predicting growth rates that follow a quadratic trend.

**Implementation & Analysis**: [Link to the Polynomial Regression notebook/script]

### Support Vector Regression (SVR)

**Overview**: Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a powerful regression technique that uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) principles to predict continuous values.

**Use Cases**:
- Predicting stock prices.
- Estimating the time series data trends.

**Implementation & Analysis**: [Link to the SVR notebook/script]

## Comparative Analyses

### Multiple Linear Regression Model vs Perceptron
