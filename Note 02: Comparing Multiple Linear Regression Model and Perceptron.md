# README: Multiple Linear Regression Model vs. Perceptron

## Overview

This project provides a comparison between two popular machine learning models: the **Multiple Linear Regression** model and the **Perceptron** model. Both models are used for prediction tasks, but they differ in their approach, assumptions, and applications.

### Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. The model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. It is used to predict continuous outcomes.

### Perceptron
The Perceptron is a type of artificial neuron used in machine learning, particularly in binary classification tasks. It’s one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks and is the building block of more complex neural networks. Unlike Multiple Linear Regression, the Perceptron can be used for classification tasks rather than regression.

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Implementation

### Multiple Linear Regression

The Multiple Linear Regression model is implemented using the `LinearRegression` class from the `scikit-learn` library. The dataset used includes multiple features (independent variables) that predict a continuous target variable.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load dataset
# Assuming X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test are already defined

# Initialize the model
mlr_model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
mlr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
mlr_predictions = mlr_model.predict(X_test)
```

### Perceptron

The Perceptron model is implemented using the `Perceptron` class from the `scikit-learn` library. The dataset used for this model involves binary classification.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron

# Load dataset
# Assuming X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test are already defined

# Initialize the model
perceptron_model = Perceptron()

# Train the model
perceptron_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
perceptron_predictions = perceptron_model.predict(X_test)
```

## Evaluation Metrics

### Multiple Linear Regression

The performance of the Multiple Linear Regression model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors between actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

### Perceptron

The performance of the Perceptron model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Additional metrics to evaluate the quality of the classification.

|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Type of Task**              | Regression (Predicts continuous outcomes)      | Classification (Binary or multi-class)     |
| **Model Type**                | Statistical                                    | Neural Network (Single-layer)              |
| **Assumptions**               | Assumes a linear relationship between variables| No assumptions about the data distribution |
| **Learning Rule**             | Least Squares                                  | Gradient Descent                           |
| **Output**                    | Continuous values                              | Binary (or multi-class with adjustments)   |
| **Use Cases**                 | Predicting house prices, sales forecasting     | Email spam detection, Image recognition    |
| **Sensitivity to Outliers**   | High                                           | Moderate                                   |
| **Complexity**                | Low (linear model)                             | Moderate (simple neural network)           |
| **Interpretability**          | High (coefficients provide insights)           | Low (weights are less interpretable)       |

## Conclusion

- **Multiple Linear Regression** is preferred for tasks where the goal is to predict a continuous outcome and there is an assumption of a linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome. It is simple, interpretable, and effective for regression tasks.
  
- **Perceptron**, on the other hand, is more suitable for binary classification tasks. It’s a simple neural network model that can handle non-linear relationships to some extent, but it is less interpretable compared to Multiple Linear Regression.

Both models serve different purposes and should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
