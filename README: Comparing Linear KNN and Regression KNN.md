# README: Comparing Linear KNN vs Regression KNN

## Introduction

This README provides a comprehensive comparison between **Linear K-Nearest Neighbors (Linear KNN)** and **Regression K-Nearest Neighbors (Regression KNN)**. Both algorithms belong to the family of KNN methods but are applied differently depending on the type of problem they are used forâ€”classification or regression.

### What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm. It assumes that similar data points exist in close proximity to each other. KNN can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

- **Classification**: Assigns a class label to a new instance based on the majority label of its neighbors.
- **Regression**: Predicts a continuous value based on the average (or weighted average) of its neighbors' values.

## Linear KNN vs Regression KNN

### 1. **Purpose**

- **Linear KNN**: Used for classification tasks. It predicts the class label of a data point by analyzing the most frequent class among its k nearest neighbors.
- **Regression KNN**: Used for regression tasks. It predicts a continuous value by averaging the values of the k nearest neighbors.

### 2. **Algorithm Process**

- **Linear KNN**:
  - Determine the number of neighbors \(k\).
  - Compute the distance between the query point and all the training data points.
  - Select the \(k\) nearest data points.
  - Assign the most common class label among the \(k\) neighbors to the query point.

- **Regression KNN**:
  - Determine the number of neighbors \(k\).
  - Compute the distance between the query point and all the training data points.
  - Select the \(k\) nearest data points.
  - Calculate the average (or weighted average) of the continuous values of the \(k\) neighbors.
  - Assign this average value as the predicted value for the query point.

### 3. **Distance Metrics**

Both methods commonly use the same distance metrics:

- **Euclidean Distance**: The most common distance metric.
- **Manhattan Distance**: Often used for data with higher dimensions.
- **Minkowski Distance**: Generalization of the Euclidean and Manhattan distances.

### 4. **Hyperparameters**

- **Linear KNN**:
  - Number of neighbors \(k\)
  - Distance metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
  - Weighting function (uniform or distance-based)

- **Regression KNN**:
  - Number of neighbors \(k\)
  - Distance metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
  - Weighting function (uniform or distance-based)

### 5. **Output**

- **Linear KNN**:
  - A discrete class label.
  - Example: Given a dataset with classes A and B, the output could be either A or B.

- **Regression KNN**:
  - A continuous value.
  - Example: Given a dataset of house prices, the output could be a specific price, e.g., $250,000.

### 6. **Applications**

- **Linear KNN**:
  - Used in scenarios where the task is to categorize items into discrete classes.
  - Examples: Spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis.

- **Regression KNN**:
  - Used in scenarios where the task is to predict a continuous quantity.
  - Examples: Predicting house prices, stock market forecasting, weather prediction.

### 7. **Advantages**

- **Linear KNN**:
  - Simple to implement.
  - No need for a training phase, making it flexible to changes in the dataset.
  - Effective for low-dimensional data.

- **Regression KNN**:
  - Simple to implement.
  - No need for a training phase.
  - Can handle non-linear relationships without any modifications.

### 8. **Disadvantages**

- **Linear KNN**:
  - Computationally expensive for large datasets.
  - Sensitive to the choice of \(k\) and the distance metric.
  - Poor performance with high-dimensional data (curse of dimensionality).

- **Regression KNN**:
  - Computationally expensive for large datasets.
  - Sensitive to outliers and noise.
  - Poor performance with high-dimensional data.

### 9. **Scalability**

- Both Linear KNN and Regression KNN struggle with large datasets due to the need to compute distances for all training samples.

### 10. **Example Code**

Here's a basic implementation in Python using `scikit-learn`:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier, KNeighborsRegressor

# Example for Linear KNN (Classification)
classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_class = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Example for Regression KNN
regressor = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=5)
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_regress = regressor.predict(X_test)
```

### Final Thoughts

- **Linear KNN** is ideal for classification tasks where the goal is to assign a category to a new data point based on its neighbors.
- **Regression KNN** is suitable for regression tasks where the objective is to predict a continuous value.

Both methods are easy to implement and understand but have limitations regarding scalability and sensitivity to parameter choices.
